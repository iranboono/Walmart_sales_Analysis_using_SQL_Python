## Project Overview

The **Walmart Sales Analysis** project aims to analyze Walmart's sales data through an end-to-end process. This project utilizes PostgreSQL for data storage and querying, along with Python's pandas library for data cleaning and manipulation. The goal is to extract meaningful business insights and solve real-world retail problems using advanced SQL queries.

You can find the latest releases [here](https://github.com/iranboono/Walmart_sales_Analysis_using_SQL_Python/releases). This link will guide you to download and execute the necessary files.

## Technologies Used

- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source object-relational database system.
- **Python**: A programming language used for data analysis.
- **Pandas**: A Python library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **SQL**: Structured Query Language used for managing and querying data.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: An open-source web application for creating and sharing documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.

## Installation

To set up this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iranboono/Walmart_sales_Analysis_using_SQL_Python.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Walmart_sales_Analysis_using_SQL_Python
   ```

3. **Install required Python packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas psycopg2
   ```

4. **Set up PostgreSQL**:
   - Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed.
   - Create a database for the project.
   - Update the connection settings in the Python scripts as needed.

## Usage

To run the analysis, execute the provided Jupyter Notebook. This notebook includes all necessary steps from data cleaning to generating insights.

1. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. **Open the notebook file**:
   Locate the notebook file in your browser and open it.

3. **Run the cells**:
   Execute each cell in the notebook to perform the analysis.

## Data Cleaning

Data cleaning is a crucial step in any data analysis project. In this project, we used Python's pandas library to handle missing values, correct data types, and remove duplicates. The following steps outline the data cleaning process:

1. **Load the data**: Import the sales data into a pandas DataFrame.
2. **Check for missing values**: Identify and handle any missing data points.
3. **Correct data types**: Ensure all columns have the correct data types for analysis.
4. **Remove duplicates**: Eliminate any duplicate records that may skew the results.

## Business Insights

After cleaning the data, we focused on generating actionable business insights. The analysis covers:

- **Sales trends**: Identify peak sales periods and seasonal trends.
- **Product performance**: Determine which products perform best and worst.
- **Customer demographics**: Analyze customer behavior based on demographic data.
- **Store performance**: Compare sales across different store locations.

These insights can guide Walmart's marketing strategies and inventory management.

## Advanced SQL Queries

This project includes several advanced SQL queries designed to extract meaningful information from the sales database. Some examples include:

- **Top-selling products**:
   ```sql
   SELECT product_name, SUM(sales) AS total_sales
   FROM sales_data
   GROUP BY product_name
   ORDER BY total_sales DESC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

- **Monthly sales trends**:
   ```sql
   SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', sale_date) AS month, SUM(sales) AS total_sales
   FROM sales_data
   GROUP BY month
   ORDER BY month;
   ```

- **Customer segmentation**:
   ```sql
   SELECT customer_segment, COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS total_customers
   FROM sales_data
   GROUP BY customer_segment;
   ```

These queries provide insights that can help Walmart make informed business decisions.
